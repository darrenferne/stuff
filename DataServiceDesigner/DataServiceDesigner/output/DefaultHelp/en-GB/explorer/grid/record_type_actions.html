    <h3>Selected Record Actions</h3>
    <p>These are the actions that are available for the current type of data being displayed.</p>
    <p>Whether they are enabled or not depends on the records that are currently selected.  Some actions can only be performed when no records, one record or multiple records are selected (or a combination of all three).</p>
    <p>Descriptions of the actions themselves can be found by hovering over the action in question.</p>
